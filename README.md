# GrapeSEED AI
This project explores whether AI could be used for English education for children.
It integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 and UneeQ's Digital Human to create an artificial English teacher.

The project is built on top of [this](https://gitlab.com/uneeq-oss/examples/tree/master) example repository. It consists of three microservices:

### Token
The purpose of this application is to return a single use token as generated by the UneeQ API server, using a private
token which is secret to this application. By generating tokens in this way, customer secrets can be kept securely
within this application and not exposed via an HTML front end application.

### Web Front End
- [HTML / Javascript](https://github.com/Mattegray/grapeseed-ai/tree/main/web/node)

### Conversation Platform API
This application implements conversation platform integration with a UneeQ digital human. The application can be configured to connect a UneeQ digital human to Dialogflow, Dialogflow CX, Watson, Lex, Wolfram Alpha, and Directline concurrently.
